ANGLE requires **d3dcompiler_43.dll** at run time.  You can install
this DLL on your system by downloading and installing the **DirectX
End-User Runtimes (June 2010)** from Microsoft, or you might be able
to just ship that DLL by itself with your application.

The runtimes installer has some license conditions you should be aware
of, which are shown on the screen when you run the installer.  For
example, it disallows you from reverse engineering the software, or
disclosing the results of any benchmark tests of the software.  If you
redistribute parts of it to your users, you must make them agree to
terms like this too.
